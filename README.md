# Group_data_columns_to_rows
## How to group data inside columns in an Excel File to rows, save the original and transformed data into a new Excel File using Python

* I wanted to get groups that are unique, and each of these unqiue groups contains multiple clients per row. 

* To achieve this objective, I worked with Lists, converted them into Dictionaries. After the Keys and Values were obtained, I converted them back to Lists.

* I experienced with loading data from Excel 01, and then copied those date into new Excel 02.

* I also exported the lists from converted Keys and Values into a new worksheet in the Excel 02.

**Disclaimer: The contents in Excel 01 are made up figures. They were created to show how the Python codes work.**
